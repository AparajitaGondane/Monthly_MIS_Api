# Comparative Monthly MIS

This project focuses on creating a dynamic and visually intuitive reporting dashboard with the following key features:

**Enhanced Sorting**: Prioritizes non-zero revenue from the previous month for better analytics.

**Bill Representation**: Displays bill values in lakhs (divided by 100,000) with two decimal precision while retaining actual integer counts in a comma-separated format.

**Emphasized Averages**: Bold styling for the "Average" column for quick visual reference.

**Conditional Formatting**: Monthly values below the average are displayed in red, and those above in green for easy comparison.

**Optimized Client Display**:
Client names are displayed in title case and truncated to 8 characters.
Names of combined individual circles or group companies are clickable, triggering a popup with detailed data in the same format.

**Filter Customization**: A "Value + Count" filter option where the count font size is reduced by 2 points relative to the value.

**Date Simplification**: Month names are displayed in a three-letter, title-case format (e.g., Aug, Jun), omitting the year.

**Technologies & Frameworks** :``
The project will involve front-end formatting, responsive design, and backend integration to handle data formatting, conditional rendering, and interactivity efficiently.
